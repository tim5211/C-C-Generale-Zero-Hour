Battle for Control in the Island Jungles!
Island Jungle Combat V1 is a large 3-player skirmish and multiplayer map set on a sprawling, jungle-covered island. The terrain is a mix of open fields, elevated hills, narrow passes, and scattered structures that create opportunities for ambushes and intense firefights.

Each player begins in a separate region of the island, with land bridges and central routes forming the key access points between zones. Capture tech structures, secure supply depots, and dominate the map’s contested midsection to claim victory.

Key Features:
Jungle Island Layout – Natural chokepoints, bodies of water, and cliffs shape the battlefield with plenty of flanking routes and defensive zones.

Garrisonable Structures – Use buildings for cover, control, and strategic firing positions.

Tech Structures & Expansion Zones – Vital structures and bonus points are spread across the island to reward exploration and expansion.

Balanced Resource Points – Equally spaced supply depots allow for fair and competitive play.

Will you control the center or push around the flanks?
Adapt your strategy, expand aggressively, and outsmart your opponents in Island Jungle Combat V1!
