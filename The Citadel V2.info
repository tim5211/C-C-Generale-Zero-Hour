Siege the Stronghold – Dominate the Center!

The Citadel V2 is a large 4-player skirmish and multiplayer map built for tactical showdowns and siege warfare. Set on a circular island surrounded by water, players start in equally spaced outer zones with access routes spiraling toward the central high ground — the Citadel.

This fortified plateau is heavily defended and houses key tech structures and resource points, making it the ultimate strategic objective for controlling the battlefield.

Key Features:

Central Fortress Citadel – Capture the middle to gain a stronghold with defensive buildings and tech bonuses.
Layered Terrain Rings – Move through outer, mid, and inner rings while managing chokepoints and approach paths.
Multiple Entry Points – Engage from bridges or flank through alternate land routes.
Balanced Resource Zones – Ensure long, intense matches with evenly distributed supplies and expansion areas.
Defensive Elevation – Use cliffs and height advantage to outplay opponents pushing toward the center.

⚠ Multiplayer Notice:
All players must have The Citadel V2 installed to play together seamlessly.
