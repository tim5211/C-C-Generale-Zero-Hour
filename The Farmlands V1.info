The Farmlands V1 Readme
Skirmish in the Heart of Industry and Open Land!

The Farmlands V1 is a large 4-player skirmish and multiplayer map set in a resource-rich countryside. At the core of the battlefield lies a fortified industrial zone surrounded by farmland and scattered crash sites. Wide open terrain offers mobility, while the urbanized center encourages aggressive tech control and defensive stand-offs.

Each player starts on a separate edge of the map, with symmetrical access to the central zone. Elevation changes, dense building clusters, and outer supply routes make for high-stakes engagements from multiple directions.

Key Features:
Central Industrial Hub – A dense cluster of garrisonable structures and tech buildings creates a strategic hotspot for control and defense.

Symmetrical 4-Player Layout – Balanced starting zones on each edge ensure fair multiplayer matches.

Crash Sites & Debris Zones – Scattered wreckage and terrain features provide light cover and visual storytelling elements.

Open Terrain & Supply Lines – Farmland regions offer expansion room and flanking opportunities. Multiple resource zones support prolonged battles.

Urban Warfare Meets Rural Chaos – Adapt your tactics based on where the fight takes you—whether breaching the central complex or cutting off enemy supply lines from the outskirts.

Will you dominate the central compound or starve your enemies from the flanks?
